== Description ==

Secure your website with the most effective bot recognition and mitigation plugin on the market. With years of development, SiaraShield leverages the complexity of the human eye to distinguish legitimate users from bad bots.

Use SiaraShield for the best WordPress security available on the market.  This simple plugin blocks bad bots from entering and submitting online forms such as contact-us and review forms, creating accounts, or verifying passwords and password changes.  This test is easily passed by people but impossible for computer bots to solve.  Additionally, the Lockout feature will re-direct bad bots and attackers to an error page which features an integrated two-factor verification for any true person who gets accidently caught in the timeout area.

Other spam and bot protection products on the market rely heavily on a conventional static CAPTCHA which is easily bypassed by modern bots. Google’s reCAPTCHA, which is often the backbone of many WordPress Security products relies on allowing Google to monitor all your pages and regular tweaking of security ratings to ensure your customers pass but bad bots are blocked.  And, most importantly, reCAPTCHA relies heavily on whether your customer is in the Google ecosystem.  If not, your customer will likely be directed to a conventional CAPTCHA – which, as previously noted, is easily solved by modern bots.

Other products on the market use lists of known bot IP addresses (which VPNs render useless), coding fingerprints (which are quickly side-stepped with simple changes to the code) or denying service to older browsers (which works only sometimes on older bots). However, SiaraShield uses completely different approach. Our sophisticated mathematical algorithm is designed in such way that makes the challenge only understandable for human visual system and therefore, it is not meaningful for computer programs.
